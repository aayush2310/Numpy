Numpy is a low level library written in C(and FORTRAN) for high level mathematical functions.NumPy cleverly overcomes the problem of running slower  algorithms on Python
by using multidimensional arrays and functions that operate arrays.Any algorithm can then be expressed as a function on arrays,allowing the algorithms to be run quickly.

Applications of Numpy:-
1)a powerful N-dimensional array object
2)sophesticated(broadcasting) functions
3)tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
4)useful linear algebra,Fourier transform and random number capabilities.

Numpy has only one data-structure.

  Properties of Numpy:-
  1)Homogenous
  2)Only be numbers(Number,Float,Complex).Actually can hold strings,but we dont use it that way.
  3)Fixed item size
